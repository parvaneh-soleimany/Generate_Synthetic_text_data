# Generate_Synthetic_text_data

This project explores the generation of synthetic tabular data using Large Language Models (LLMs) on textual datasets. The primary goal is to leverage the generative capabilities of LLMs to create structured data while examining their handling of biases inherent in the original dataset. By training LLMs on this data, we aim to observe whether the models replicate or amplify existing biases when generating new data. In addition to understanding LLM behavior with biased data, the project also investigates techniques for bias mitigation, striving to reduce unintended bias propagation in the synthetic outputs.
